Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a type of 
cancer of blood and bone marrow, which is not only fatal but 
also very expensive to treat. Leukemia detection at early stage 
would can save lives and money. It is very common in children.
Most leukemia in children is treated. Research studies reported 
that leukemia brings changes in white blood cells count.
Currently for initial ALL diagnosis evaluation is done 
manually. This is time consuming and prone to errors. The 
proposed model is based on data collected from Kaggle 
dataset. The MobileNetV2 model is a lightweight model 
through which I have achieved an accuracy of 98.88% on 
training data and accuracy of 98.58% on testing data, with 
precision of 0.986, recall of 0.9858 and F1 score of 0.9857.
Experiments were conducted on dataset containing 3256 
images from 89 patients suspected of ALL, including 25 
healthy individuals. Currently the dataset contains three 
stages which are Early Pre-B, Pre-B and Pro-B ALL.
